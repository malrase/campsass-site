      This year's #{link_to "@CampSass", "https://twitter.com/CampSass"} was everything I could have hoped for. Intimate, friendly, and educational. Met so many great people!

    Especially, thank you to #{link_to "9Labs", "http://9labs.io/"} and Jay, who helped put the conference together. Atlanta was exceedingly welcoming and we thoroughly enjoyed experiencing the city.
