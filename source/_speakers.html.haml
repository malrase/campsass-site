      Hampton is the creator of Sass and is super-excited to host CampSass. He thinks he's pretty funny and will regale all atendees with his jokes. He wrote this in the third person, which is kinda weird. He's also the creator of #{link_to "Haml", "http://haml.info/", :target=>"_blank"}, Tritium, and Wikipedia Mobile. He's the co-founder of Rarebit, who are currently working on making an awesome dictionary app that he'd love to talk to you about.
